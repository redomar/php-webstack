<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website is a project i work on in my free time. I am not exactly sure what i will use this website for but i will be trying to make a forums/blog area and downloads pages availble soon, I have not started coding some of them yet. I will hopefully work on the members page next week where you can see the other members</p>
<p>My friend <a href='/Admin'>Bilal</a> is also working on a site of his own and it is not finished aswell, he works more on the designing while i look into the functionality, go give him a vist at <a target='_blank' href='http://hello-world.cu.cc/'>http://hello-world.cu.cc/</a></p>
